## Updated CKAN default versions to latest stable versions

We have updated ckan-devstaller to suggest the recent releases of CKAN [2.11.4](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.11/changelog.html#v-2-11-4-2025-10-29) and [2.10.9](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.10/changelog.html#v-2-10-9-2025-10-29).

## Added the "Developing with WSL" page in the Reference section

Developers using Windows may benefit from the new [Developing with WSL](/docs/reference/developing-with-wsl) page in the Reference section to try their builds of ckan-devstaller and verify things work on a new install of Ubuntu 22.04.

Alternatively if not trying to reset an entire WSL environment, developers can look into [`ckan-devstaller uninstall`](/docs/tutorials/uninstall-ckan).

## Added install script switch to Builder page

There is now a switch on the Builder page that is enabled by default for including the installation script for ckan-devstaller before running it. This is necessary for users that don't have ckan-devstaller installed yet and are using the Builder over the Quick Start scripts.

## Default start with the Builder page

We've changed "Get Started" links (and similar links) to the Builder page instead of the Quick Start page to users can quickly access the Builder again and get started using ckan-devstaller.

## Update ckan-compose links to use ckan-devstaller branch

We've updated ckan-compose links to use [the ckan-devstaller branch](https://github.com/tino097/ckan-compose/tree/ckan-devstaller).

## Update VirtualBox notice with better formatting

To ensure users using VirtualBox see the full command for adding a user to the sudoers file, we've improved the formatting of the note.

## GitHub Action to verify CKAN install runs

We've added a GitHub Action to run on push to the main branch to verify that a CKAN-only install runs. This doesn't include verbose testing but rather ensuring that the ckan-devstaller finishes without errors.

## New --skip-run flag

We've added a `--skip-run` flag to skip running CKAN at the end of installation.
