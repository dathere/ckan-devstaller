ckan-devstaller attempts to install a CKAN instance from source along with [ckan-compose](https://github.com/tino097/ckan-compose) and other optional features, intended for development use in a new Ubuntu 22.04 instance.

<Callout title="Please run ckan-devstaller in a new Ubuntu 22.04 instance only" type="error">Make sure `ckan-devstaller` is run in a **new** Ubuntu 22.04 instanceof. Do NOT run `ckan-devstaller` in an existing instance that is important for your usage.</Callout>

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Note for VirtualBox users">If you are using Ubuntu 22.04 on VirtualBox, you may need to add your user to the sudoers file before running the ckan-devstaller install script. Open a terminal in your virtual machine (VM), run `su -` and log in as the root user with the password you used to set up the VM, then type `sudo adduser <username> sudo` where `<username>` is your username then restart your VM and run the ckan-devstaller installer script.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Note for ARM64 users">Currently `ckan-devstaller` supports `x86_64` architecture. `ARM64` support is planned.</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Currently you have two options to choose from for installation. Paste one of the following scripts into your new Ubuntu 22.04 instance's terminal:

## (Option 1/2) Install with interactive mode

```bash
wget -O - https://github.com/dathere/ckan-devstaller/releases/download/0.2.1/install.bash | bash -s default
```

## (Option 2/2) Install with non-interactive mode with a specific config

The following script will install the following:

- CKAN 2.11.3
- [ckan-compose](https://github.com/tino097/ckan-compose/tree/ckan-devstaller)
- [DataStore extension](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.11/maintaining/datastore.html)
