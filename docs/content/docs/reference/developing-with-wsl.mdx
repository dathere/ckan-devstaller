When developing ckan-devstaller on Windows, using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) can be advantageous to demo an Ubuntu 22.04 environment without having to set up a virtual machine.

### Install the Ubuntu-22.04 distribution

You'll need to have the Ubuntu-22.04 distribution installed by running the following command:

```bash
wsl --install Ubuntu-22.04 --version 2
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Export a base image

</Step>
</Steps>

Here's the expected set up where we create a WSL folder:

```files
/c/Users/rzmk/WSL
├── images
|   ├── ubuntu-22-04-snapshot.tar
├── instances
|   ├── cdr.vdhx
```

Now try to access your new Ubuntu 22.04 instance `cdr` as the `root` user by running:

```bash
wsl -d cdr
```

Once logged in as `root`, you'll want to edit the `/etc/wsl.conf` file and modify it so you can login as an admin user instead of `root`. We can use the `nano` editor to modify the file:

```bash
nano /etc/wsl.conf
```

Modify the file by adding a `[user]` section with the value `default=rzmk` (where `rzmk` is your username). The file should look similar to this:

```ini
[boot]
systemd=true

[user]
default=rzmk
```

Now leave your instance:

```bash
exit
```

Then terminate the instance:

```bash
wsl --terminate cdr
```

Run the instance again and you should be logged in as your admin user by default now:

```bash
wsl -d cdr
```

Great, now you can go to the home directory and run one of the [quick start](/docs) scripts:

```bash
cd ~/
```

When you want to remove your instance (e.g. so that you can start a brand new instance) then run the following to unregister it:

```bash
wsl --unregister cdr
```
