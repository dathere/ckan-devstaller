## CKAN and extensions

The CKAN repository selected from ckan-devstaller is installed to `/usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan`. Extensions are also installed as sibling folders. For example if `ckanext-scheming` is also installed:

```files
/usr/lib/ckan/default/src
├── ckan
│   ├── ...
├── ckanext-scheming
│   ├── ...
```

The configuration file for CKAN is installed at `/etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini`:

```files
/etc/ckan/default
├── ckan.ini
├── who.ini
```

## ckan-compose

We install certain first-time install files and [`ckan-compose`](https://github.com/tino097/ckan-compose/tree/ckan-devstaller) as a directory in the user's home (`~`) directory. For example for the user `adam`:

```files
/home/adam
├── ahoy
├── dpp_default_config.ini
├── get-docker.sh
├── permissions.sql
├── ckan-compose
│   ├── ...
```

After running ckan-devstaller you may also see many files starting with `qsv` and `README`. There are various files you can remove after running ckan-devstaller including:

- `dpp_default_config.ini`
- `get-docker.sh`
- `permissions.sql`
- `README`
- The various `qsv` files

Here's a script you can run for cleanup after running ckan-devstaller:

```bash
cd ~/
rm -rf dpp_default_config.ini get-docker.sh permissions.sql README qsv*
```

## DataPusher+

We install a compatible version of qsv with the DataPusher+ variant named `qsvdp` and move it to `/usr/local/bin`:

```files
/usr/local/bin
├── qsvdp
```

The ckanext-scheming and DataPusher+ extensions are installed in the same location as other CKAN extensions:

```files
/usr/lib/ckan/default/src
├── ckan
|   ├── ...
├── ckanext-scheming
|   ├── ...
├── datapusher_plus
|   ├── ...
```
